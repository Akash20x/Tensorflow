## **WHY IS TENSORFLOW SO POPULAR ?& WHY SHOULD YOU LEARN ?**
 TensorFlow is a free and open-source machine learning library. It was created by Google Brain Team researchers and engineers as part of Google's Machine Intelligence research organization for the purpose of performing machine learning and deep neural network research, but the technology is flexible enough to be used in a range of other fields!. TensorFlow is a symbolic math library based on dataflow and differentiable programming. It is used for both research and production at Google. The name "TensorFlow" derives from the operations that such neural networks perform on multidimensional data arrays, which are referred to as _*tensors*_.
 
 ### Features of TensorFlow
 -  Parallel Neural Network Training.
 -  Models can be developed easily.
 -  Consists of Machine Learning APIs.
 -  Availability of Statistical Distributions.
 -  Easy deployment and computation using CPU, GPU.
 -  Complex Numeric Computations can be done.
 -  Pre-trained models for mobiles, embedded devices, and production.
 -  Contains pre-trained models and datasets.
 -  It offers TensorFlow Extended (TFX) to deploy a production-ready ML pipeline for training and inference.
 -  TensorFlow is a _open -source_ platform, free to use and allows developers to build and deploy Machine Learning models.

### Applications and Uses:
 It is an open source library, using data flow graphs to build models. It allows developers to create large-scale neural networks with many layers. TensorFlow is mainly used for : *Classification*, *Perception*, *Understanding*, *Discovering*, *Prediction* and *Creation*.  
 
 **_The Main Use Cases of TensorFlow_**  
    1. Voice / Sound Recognition.  
    2. Image and Face recognition.  
    3. Text Based Applications.  
    4. Recommendation Systems.  
    5. Natural Language Processing.  

### Why is TensorFlow So Popular..?  
  1. **TensorFlow made Machine learning easy:** With pre-trained models, data, and high-level APIS, it has become easy for everyone to build ML models.  
  2. **Ready-made models for production purposes:** TensorFlow supports pre-trained models which can be used instantly for production and experiment.  
  3. **Using TensorFlow, ML is used as a service:** Machine Learning has became a service with the help of TensorFlow.  
  4. **TensorFlow provides excellent functionalities and services** when compared to other popular deep learning frameworks.
  5. **TensorFlow is a low-level library which provides more flexibility.** Thus you can define your own functionalities or services for your models. 
  6. **Responsive Construct:** We can easily view each and every element of the graph with TensorFlow, which is not possible with Numpy or SciKit.
  7. **Feature Columns:** Tensorflow contains feature columns that act as intermediates between raw data and estimators, allowing you to connect your input data to your model.
  8. **It is free and open-sourced:** TensorFlow is an Open-Source Software released under the Apache License. 
  9. **Extensive support for tooling and integration.**
  10. **TensorFlow has research and development Backing from GOOGLE.** TensorFlow models can be run without a traditional computer platform in the Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine.

### Why Should you Learn ? 
  1. **_One of the most preferred frameworks:_**    
      According to the StackOverflow Developers Survey 2020, TensorFlow is one of the most popular frameworks among developers. Around 65% of those respondents showed an interest in continuing to create models with TensorFlow. With Google's help, the library will be updated on a regular basis to meet the changing demands of developers. 
  2. **_Build a Strong foundation of Deep Learning:_**  
      You may have got training in deep learning and how to create machine learning and deep learning models. However, learning alone will not benefit you until you put the principles into practice. TensorFlow provides that platform, and as you gain experience with it, you'll be able to recognize the challenges that arise when developing models to tackle real-world problems.  
  3. **_Get a chance to work on ML-powered projects_**    
      TensorFlow is used by businesses like as Airbnb, Google, Intel, Coca-Cola, GE Healthcare, and Twitter. Because it is an open-source library developed by Google, it is widely used in businesses. If you know how to use TensorFlow, you'll become a go-to employee for machine learning projects and have the opportunity to prove your abilities.  
  4. **_Better job opportunities_**  
     Knowing how to use machine learning is a must-have talent for most data-related employment openings. All jobs require a good knowledge of constructing ML and deep learning models, whether they are data scientist, data analyst, machine learning engineer, or AI specialist. Obviously, learning TensorFlow allows you to apply for all of these positions and improve your job prospects.  
  5. **_Better salary prospects_**  
     A machine learning engineer with deep learning abilities makes an average yearly income of $112,331 in the United States, according to Payscale. Such experts can make much more as they gain experience, and even entry-level professionals can fetch substantial wages. Learning TensorFlow will enable you to create and deploy deep learning models, as well as validate them in front of employers.
