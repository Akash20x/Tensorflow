## _Tensorflow Intro_
***
- Deep Learning is a category of machine learning models (=algorithms) that use multi-layer neural networks.
- TensorFlow is a framework created by Google for creating multi-layer neural networks (=Deep Learning Models).
-  It can be used across a range of tasks but has a particular focus on training and inference of deep neural networks.


## _Important features of TensorFlow_
***
- It includes a feature of that defines, optimizes and calculates mathematical expressions easily with the help of multi-dimensional arrays called tensors.
- It includes a programming support of deep neural networks and machine learning techniques.
- It includes a high scalable feature of computation with various data sets.
- TensorFlow uses GPU computing, automating management. It also includes a unique feature of optimization of same memory and the data used.

## _Prerequisites_
***
- Before proceeding with this tutorial, you need to have a basic knowledge of any Python programming language. Knowledge of artificial intelligence concepts will be a plus point.

## _Installation_
***
- ```pip install tensorflow```
- This command can install latest tensorflow library in your system.

## _How it works ?_

- TensorFlow enables you to build dataflow graphs and structures to define how data moves through a graph by taking inputs as a multi-dimensional array called Tensor. It allows you to construct a flowchart of operations that can be performed on these inputs, which goes at one end and comes at the other end as output.
- Tensor Flow provides all of this for the programmer by using way of the Python language. Python is simple to test and paintings with, and offers reachable strategies to specific how excessive-degree abstractions may be coupled together. Nodes and tensors in TensorFlow are Python devices, and TensorFlow programs are themselves Python programs.
- The real math operations, but, aren’t completed in Python. The libraries of adjustments which may be available through TensorFlow are written as excessive-normal basic performance C++ binaries. Python genuinely directs website online traffic a number of the quantities, and gives immoderate-degree programming abstractions to hook them together.
- TensorFlow packages can be run on maximum any purpose that’s on hand: a nearby device, a cluster within the cloud, iOS and Android devices, CPUs or GPUs. If you use Google’s own cloud, you can run TensorFlow on Google’s custom TensorFlow Processing Unit (TPU) silicon for similarly acceleration. The resulting fashions created with the beneficial useful resource of TensorFlow, even though, can be deployed on most any tool in which they’ll be used to serve predictions.
- TensorFlow 2.0, launched in October 2019, made over the framework in lots of strategies based on character feedback, to make it simpler to art work with (e.g., through the use of the especially easy Keras API for version schooling) and in addition performant. Distributed education is an entire lot lots less difficult to run manner to a ultra-modern API, and help for TensorFlow Lite makes it feasible to installation fashions on a greater variety of systems. However, code written for earlier versions of TensorFlow should be rewritten—occasionally fine slightly, now and again considerably—to take most benefit of new TensorFlow 2.0 talents.

## _TensorFlow permits the subsequent:_
***
- Tensor Flow helps you to deploy computation to as a minimum one or extra CPUs or GPUs in a computing tool, server, or mobile device in a completely easy manner. This way the matters may be completed very speedy.
- Tensor Flow lets you specific your computation as a statistics glide graph.
- Tensor Flow helps you to visualize the graph using the in-constructed tensor board. You can test and debug the graph very without difficulty.
- Tensor Flow offers the amazing regular overall performance with an capability to iterate brief, teach models faster and run more experiments.

## _Architecture_
***
- The architecture of the Tensor Flow permits it assisting all the above and lots more.
- First of all, you have to take into account that all through Tensor Flow, you collect a graph in that you outline the constants, variables, operations and then you definitely absolutely in fact execute it. The graph is a facts shape which includes all of the constants, variables and operations that you want to do.
- The node represents an operation.
- The edges are organizations of records structures (tensors), in which an output of 1 operation (from one node) will become the enter for each exceptional operation.
