[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is open source artificial intelligence library, using data flow graphs to build models. 
It allows developers to develop and train ML models so that they can create large-scale neural networks with many layers.
It is mainly used for Classification, Perception, Understanding, Discovering, Prediction and Creation of the models.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the
Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organization to
conduct machine learning and deep neural networks research.


<h2> Interesting Facts about Tensorflow </h2>

Itâ€™s a powerful machine learning framework. The most famous deep learning library in the world is Google's TensorFlow.
Google product uses machine learning in all of its products to improve the search engine, translation, image captioning or recommendations.

TensorFlow not only provides stable [Python](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python)
but also prividing [C++](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/cc) APIs, as well as
non-guaranteed backward compatible API for other languages.

## Installation

To download the source code, clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/anubhav201241/Tensorflow.git
```

To run them, you also need the latest version of TensorFlow. To install it:
```
pip install tensorflow
```

or (with GPU support):
```
pip install tensorflow_gpu
```

For more details about TensorFlow installation, you can check [TensorFlow Installation Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)


<h2> TensorFlow Architecture </h2>

</div>

TensorFlow Serving is a flexible, high-performance serving system for machine learning models, designed for production environments. 
TensorFlow Serving makes it easy to deploy new algorithms and experiments, while keeping 
the same server architecture and APIs. TensorFlow Serving provides out of the box integration with TensorFlow models, 
but can be easily extended to serve other types of models.

Tensorflow architecture works in three parts:
<ul>
  <li>Preprocessing the data</li>
  <li>Build the model</li>
  <li>Train and estimate the model</li>
</ul>

## TensorFlow Servable

These are the central uncompleted units in TensorFlow serving. Servables are the objects that the clients use to perform the computation.
The size of a servable is flexible. A single servable may consist of anything from a lookup table to a unique model in a tuple of interface models. 
Servable should be of any type and interface, which enabling flexibility and future improvements such as Streaming results, Asynchronous modes of operation
and Experimental APIs

## Servable Versions
TensorFlow server can handle one or more versions of the servables, over the lifetime of any single server instance. 
It opens the door for new algorithm configurations, weights, and other data can be loaded over time. 
They also can enable more than one version of a servable to be charged at a time. 
They also allow more than one version of a servable to be loaded concurrently, supporting roll-out and experimentation gradually.

## Servable Streams
A sequence of versions of any servable sorted by increasing version of numbers.

## TensorFlow Models
A serving represents a model in one or more servables. A machine-learned model includes one or more algorithm and lookup the embedding tables. 
A servable can also serve like a fraction of a model for example, an example, a large lookup table be served as many instances.

## TensorFlow Loaders
Loaders manage a servable's life cycle. The loader API enables common infrastructure which is independent of the specific learning algorithm, 
data, or product use-cases involved.

## Sources in TensorFlow Architecture
In simple terms, sources are modules that find and provide servable. Each reference provides zero or more servable streams at a time. 
For each servable stream, a source supplies only one loader instance for every servable.
Each source also provides zero or more servable streams. For each servable stream, a source supplies only one loader instance and makes available to be loaded.

## TensorFlow Managers

TensorFlow managers handle the full lifecycle of a Servables, including Loading Servables, Serving Servables, Unloading Servables
Manager observes to sources and tracks all versions. The Manager tries to fulfill causes, but it can refuse to load an Aspired version.
Managers may also postpone an "unload."

## TensorFlow Core

This manages the below aspects of servables:
<ul>
  <li>Lifecycle</li>
  <li>Metrics</li>
  <li>TensorFlow serving core satisfaction servables and loaders as the opaque objects.</li>
</ul>
